# Summary

This code pattern demonstrates the blockchain enabled crowdfunding which uses the Hyperledger Fabric to build a network to support crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is the quickest, easiest way to gather a large amount of money through donations from supporters. It has its own pros and cons. There is a probability for a fraud in a crowdfunding event. Hence blockchain has been used in this pattern to bring trust and transparency among the participants to manage it efficiently.

# Technologies

* [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain): A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all transactions in a network.

* [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)): Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based and object-oriented.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.


# Description

Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet. It's the quickest, easiest way to gather a large amount of money through donations from supporters. There are several types of crowdfunding(donation based/rewards based/debt/equity) but not all types of crowdfunding are regulated by Financial Conduct Authority.

Crowdfunding idea has lots of good but at the same time there is a big opportunity for fraud. It involves some level of risk like loss of money, locked-in investment, no income, lack of information. People are concerned about being scammed by a fraudulent request. It is because of lack of transparency and trust. There were few reported cases of fraud – particularly when compared to the number of transactions and amounts involved. The greater the number of crowdfunding platforms, the greater the risk that platform operators themselves may engage in fraud, or enable fraud. 

This pattern showcases the blockchain enabled crowdfunding which uses Hyperledger Fabric network to build a platform to aid crowdfunding. This network gives a holistic view of the requirement and its current status. This way, a need is addressed efficiently, and the problems of over-collection or under-collection for a need are reduced. The platform creates trust, accountability, and transparency of operations.
